👋 HELLO EVERYONE
I’m Ayaan Shilledar — a Computer Science undergraduate and Engineer at Nodevbuild, passionate about building
scalable, production-grade systems that solve real problems and survive real users.
Good software is quiet, intentional, and built to last.
Always learning. Always shipping.

STILL GRINDING. STILL SHIPPING.
Building software that survives real users, real load, real feedback — not tutorials or clones.
