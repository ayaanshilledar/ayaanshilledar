# HELLO EVERYONE 

I’m **Ayaan Shilledar** — a Computer Science undergraduate who enjoys building and currently working at Nodevbuild
**scalable, well-structured software** that solves real problems.

I care deeply about:
- **Clean architecture over shortcuts**
- **Real-world problems over demo projects**
- **Systems that are simple, reliable, and enjoyable to use**

STILL GRINDING. STILL SHIPPING.
Building software that survives real users, real load, real feedback — not tutorials or clones.
