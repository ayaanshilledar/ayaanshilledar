# Hi there 👋

I’m **Ayaan Shilledar** — a Computer Science undergraduate who enjoys building  
**scalable, well-structured software** that solves real problems.

I care deeply about:

- **Clean architecture over shortcuts**
- **Real-world problems over demo projects**
- **Systems that are simple, reliable, and enjoyable to use**

Good software is quiet, intentional, and built to last.

Always learning. Always shipping.

STILL GRINDING. STILL SHIPPING.
+ Zero excuses
+ Real systems, not demos
+ Production-first mindset


I’m focused on building software that survives real users, real load, and real feedback — not just tutorials or clones.

🛠️ CodeRev

A foundation-level system, not a side project

Turning keystrokes into a full-fledged online code editor —
thinking beyond UI into execution, latency, isolation, and UX at scale.
Built with the mindset of how developers actually write, run, and debug code.

🌾 Crop Journal

Tech with measurable impact

Contributing to an agri-tech system where data isn’t vanity — it drives decisions.
Working on transforming raw inputs into actionable insights that can improve productivity, planning, and outcomes on the ground.

🧠 Bits RAG

Reducing noise, increasing signal

Deeply focused on retrieval quality and reasoning reliability.
Optimizing chunking, embeddings, and context flow to ensure outputs are
grounded, accurate, and trustworthy — less hallucination, more intelligence.

🧩 Atlas

An AI assistant built for reality, not demos

Designing an interactive AI assistant with a real user loop.
Every feature is validated against actual usage, feedback, and failure modes —
real-world RAG, real constraints, real improvements.

⚙️ OPERATING MODE

Build → Break → Learn → Refine
Shipping systems that evolve, not projects that stagnate.

<sub>Still early. Still hungry. Still building. 🚀</sub>
